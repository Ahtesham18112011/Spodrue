# Day 1: Introduction to TCL and VSDSYNTH Tool Box Usage
This day introduces us to the **Tool Command Language (TCL)** and explains us the usage of the TCL langiage.

## What is TCL language?
**Tcl (Tool Command Language)** is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted programming language designed for simplicity and flexibility. It follows a multi-paradigm approach, supporting **event-driven, functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming**. 

## Learning TCL language through a User Interface software
This workshop teaches the TCL language through a UI (User Interface) software, which is capable of receiving input files (`.csv`), reading verilog files, `.lib` files and dumping the final results as a statistic table to the output file. Below is the first step to make this software:-

### Task 1 to make the software
1. Create command (for example vsdsynth) and pass `.csv` from UNIX shell to TCL script.

## Creating the command
So now we will create a UNIX shell command that will inform if the `.csv` file is not given, or it does not exists or the user has typed `-help`.
