# Day 5: Advanced Scripting Techniques and Quality of Results Generation
## Main Synthesis script to be used by Yosys
```tcl
puts "\nInfo: Creating main synthesis script to be used by Yosys"
set data "read_liberty -lib -ignore_miss_dir -setattr blackbox ${LateLibraryPath}"
set filename "$DesignName.ys"
set fileId [open $OutputDirectory/$filename "w"]
puts -nonewline $fileid $data

set netlist [glob -dir $NetlistDirectory *.v]
foreach f $netlist {
set data $f
puts -nonewline $fileId "\nread_verilog $f"
}

puts -nonewline $fileId "\nhierarchy -top $DesignName"
puts -nonewline $fileId "\nsynth -top $DesignName"
puts -nonewline $fileId "\nsplitnets -ports -format ___\ndfflibmap -liberty ${LateLibraryPath} \nopt"
puts -nonewline $fileId "\nabc -liberty ${LateLibraryPath}"
puts -nonewline $fileId "\nflatten"
puts -nonewline $fileId "\nclean -purge\niopadmap -outpad BUFX2 A:Y -bits\nopt\nclean"
puts -nonewline $fileId "\nwrite_verilog $OutputDirectory/$DesignName.synth.v"
close $fileId
puts "\nInfo: Synthesis Script created and can be accessed from path $OutputDirectory/$DesignName.ys"
puts "\nInfo: Running Synthesis"
```

1. **Script Initialization**:  
   It announces the creation of the synthesis script and prepares a new file named `<DesignName>.ys` in the specified `$OutputDirectory`.

2. **Reading Liberty File**:  
   The first command inserted is:
   ```tcl
   read_liberty -lib -ignore_miss_dir -setattr blackbox ${LateLibraryPath}
   ```
   This loads the Liberty file that provides cell characteristics, treating undefined modules as black boxes.

3. **Reading Verilog Sources**:  
   It uses `glob` to list all `.v` files in `$NetlistDirectory` and appends a `read_verilog` command for each one.

4. **Setting Top Module and Synthesizing**:  
   ```tcl
   hierarchy -top $DesignName
   synth -top $DesignName
   ```
   These ensure correct module hierarchy and start synthesis with the given top module.

5. **Netlist Output**:  
   Writes the final synthesized Verilog netlist to:
   ```tcl
   $OutputDirectory/$DesignName.synth.v
   ```

6. **Completion Logs**:  
   The script closes the file and logs that the script is ready and synthesis is being started.


## Script for editing the Yosys output file
The editing is required because in further steps, when we will do STA, which can be done by the open-source tool called OpenTimer, and this tool doesn't understands characters like \\ and *. 

```tcl
if {[catch {exec yosys -s $OutputDirectory/$DesignName.ys >& $OutputDirectory/$DesignName.synthesis.log} msg]} {
     puts "\nSynthesis failed due to errors. Please refer to log $OutputDirectory/$DesignName.synthesis.log for errors"
exit

} else {

     puts "\nInfo: Synthesis finished successfully"
}

set fileId [open /tmp/1 "w"]
puts -nonewline $fileId [exec grep -v -w "*" $OutputDirectory/$DesignName.synth.v]
close $fileId

set output [open $OutputDirectory/$DesignName.final.synth.v "w"]

set filename "/tmp/1"
set fid [open $filename r]
        while {[gets $fid line] != -1} {
        puts -nonewline $output [string map {"\\" ""} $line]
        puts -nonewline $output "\n"
}
close $fid
close $output

puts "\nInfo: Please find the synthesized netlist for $DesignName at below path. You can use this netlist for STA or PNR"
puts "$OutputDirectory/$DesignName.final.synth.v"


```
You're adding the final layer to your synthesis automationâ€”executing the synthesis, checking its success, and post-processing the resulting netlist. Here's a breakdown of what your script does:

---

### ðŸ›  1. **Running the Yosys Synthesis Flow**
```tcl
if {[catch {exec yosys -s $OutputDirectory/$DesignName.ys >& $OutputDirectory/$DesignName.synthesis.log} msg]} { ... }
```
- Uses `exec` to run Yosys with your generated script.
- Redirects both stdout and stderr into a log file.
- Wraps the call in a `catch` block to detect synthesis failure.
- On failure, it alerts the user and exits.
- On success, it confirms completion.

---

### 2. **Filtering the Netlist**
```tcl
puts -nonewline $fileId [exec grep -v -w "*" $OutputDirectory/$DesignName.synth.v]
```
- Opens a temporary file `/tmp/1`.
- Filters out lines containing only `*`, which are probably Yosys comments or metadata.
- Writes the cleaned content to `/tmp/1`.

---

### 3. **Rewriting the Netlist**
```tcl
puts -nonewline $output [string map {"\\" ""} $line]
```
- Opens the cleaned temp file for reading.
- Creates a final output file for STA/PNR.
- Removes unnecessary backslashes (escaped line continuations).
- Adds newline explicitly to preserve formatting.
