# Spodrue
A unique User Interface (UI) that will take RTL netlist & SDC constraints as an input, and will generate sythnesized netlist & pre-layout timing report as an output. It uses Yosys open-source tool for synthesis and Opentimer to generate pre-layout timing reports.

## About

This repository has a brief introduction to the Tool Command Language (TCL) and also to the Linux environment. In this workshop we learnt the TCL through developing a User Interface (UI) that receives input from a csv file and produces output in SDC format.

                                                                

## Features

- Introduction to TCL
