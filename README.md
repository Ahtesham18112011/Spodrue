## About

This repository has a brief introduction to the Tool Command Language (TCL) and also to the Linux environment. In this workshop we learnt the TCL through developing a User Interface (UI) that receives input from a csv file and produces output in SDC format.

                                                                

## Features

- Introduction to TCL
- Code for the UI
- Step by step guidance
